# Retail Sales & Inventory Analytics

This is my second full-scale data project where Iâ€™ve analysed sales, inventory, and delivery performance of a retail business using SQL, Power BI, and Python.

I created all the sample data myself to simulate a realistic retail company setup, with different branches, products, suppliers, and monthly stock levels.

## ðŸ”§ Tools I used:

- **PostgreSQL (via DBeaver)** â€“ for creating tables and running analysis queries  
- **Power BI** â€“ for building dashboards and visuals  
- **Python** â€“ for some monthly calculations and loading CSVs  
- **VS Code** â€“ for organising everything in one place

---

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s inside the project:

- **SQL folder** â€“ all the queries and table setup scripts  
- **Power BI** â€“ full 3-page dashboard with KPIs and visuals  
- **Python** â€“ for loading, checking and transforming data  
- **Screenshots** â€“ in case you want to preview visuals  
- **Data folder** â€“ final cleaned CSVs I used in the analysis

## âœ… Main things I analysed:

- Which products sold the most  
- Which branches had the most stock  
- Which suppliers delayed deliveries  
- Monthly stock trends by category
